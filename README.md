The Holojam SDK enables content creators to build complex location-based multiplayer VR experiences in a simple, unified Unity project with no advanced networking skills necessary. Its C# API provides an extensible and clean interface, allowing for rapid prototyping and extension. Additionally, it abstracts away specific VR hardware, removing the need to design single-use, bespoke creations.
