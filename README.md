The Holojam SDK enables content creators to build complex location-based multiplayer VR experiences in a simple, unified Unity project with no advanced networking skills necessary. Its C# API provides an extensible and clean interface, allowing for rapid prototyping and extension. Additionally, it abstracts away specific VR hardware, removing the need to design single-use, bespoke creations.

## Get Holojam

Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/holojamvr/HolojamSDK-Unity/releases). In Unity, Go to _'Assets -> Package -> Custom Package...'_ and import Holojam into your project.

Note: at the moment, Holojam releases are pre-configured for SteamVR (Vive). **Make sure to install the [SteamVR plugin](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/32647) in your project alongside Holojam.**

### Developer Version

For the latest (warning: may be unstable) code, clone the repository within an empty or existing Unity project under the `Assets` directory. **Before opening Unity**, copy in `Holojam-Core.dll` under `Holojam/`.
